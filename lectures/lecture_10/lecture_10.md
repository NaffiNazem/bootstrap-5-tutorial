## Introduction to list groups

List groups are a versatile and flexible component in Bootstrap that allows
you to display a list of items in a structured and interactive way. List
groups are commonly used to organize and present content in a visually
appealing manner. Bootstrap provides a set of classes that you can use to
create list groups for your web projects. List groups are useful for
displaying a collection of items, such as products, articles, or user
profiles.

### List group structure

The basic structure of a list group in Bootstrap consists of a `ul` or `ol`
element with the `list-group` class. Inside the list group, you can add one
or more `li` elements with the `list-group-item` class. Each list group item
can contain text, badges, buttons, links, and other components to enhance its
functionality and appearance.


### List group items

List group items are the individual items that make up a list group. Each
list group item can contain text, badges, buttons, links, and other
components to enhance its functionality and appearance. List group items can
be customized using different classes to change their appearance, layout, and
style.

Here are some examples of list group items in Bootstrap:

```html
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item">Item 1</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Item 2</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

### List group badges

List group badges are small, circular elements that can be used to display
additional information, such as counts, labels, or statuses, next to list
group items. Badges can be added to list group items using the `badge` class.

Here is an example of a list group item with a badge in Bootstrap:

```html
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
Item 1
<span class="badge bg-primary rounded-pill">5</span>
</li>
</ul>
```

### List group buttons

List group buttons are interactive elements that can be used to perform
actions, such as navigating to a different page, opening a modal, or
submitting a form. Buttons can be added to list group items using the `btn`
class.

Here is an example of a list group item with a button in Bootstrap:

```html
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
Item 1
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Click me</button>
</li>
</ul>
```

### List group links

List group links are clickable elements that can be used to navigate to
different pages, sections, or websites. Links can be added to list group
items using the `list-group-item` class.

Here is an example of a list group item with a link in Bootstrap:

```html
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item">
<a href="#" class="list-group-item-action">Item 1</a>
</li>
</ul>
```

### List group styles

Bootstrap provides a set of classes that allow you to customize the
appearance of list groups, including the background color, border color, and
text color. You can use classes like `list-group`, `list-group-item`,
`list-group-flush`, `list-group-horizontal`, `list-group-numbered`,
`list-group-numbered-flush`, `list-group-numbered-horizontal`,
`list-group-numbered-horizontal-flush`

Here is an example of a list group with numbered horizontal flush items in
Bootstrap:

```html
<ul class="list-group list-group-numbered list-group-numbered-horizontal list-group-numbered-horizontal-flush">
<li class="list-group-item">Item 1</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Item 2</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

## Summary

List groups are a versatile and flexible component in Bootstrap that allows
you to display a list of items in a structured and interactive way. List
groups are commonly used to organize and present content in a visually
appealing manner. Bootstrap provides a set of classes that you can use to
create list groups for your web projects. List groups can contain various
components, such as badges, buttons, and links, to enhance their
functionality and appearance. You can customize the appearance, behavior, and
functionality of list groups using various Bootstrap classes. List groups are
useful for displaying a collection of items, such as products, articles, or
user profiles.
