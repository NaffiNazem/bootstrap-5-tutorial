## Overview

In this lecture, we will learn about tabs and pills in Bootstrap. Tabs and
pills are navigation components that can be used to organize and display
content on a web page. Tabs are a set of navigation links that allow users to
switch between different sections of content on a page. Tabs are commonly used
to organize information, display multiple sections of content, or create
interactive elements on a web page. Pills are similar to tabs, but are
displayed as a horizontal or vertical list of links that can be used to
navigate between different sections of content.

## Introduction to tabs

Tabs are a set of navigation links that allow users to switch between different
sections of content on a web page. Tabs are commonly used to organize
information, display multiple sections of content, or create interactive
elements on a web page. Tabs are typically displayed as a horizontal or
vertical list of links that can be used to navigate between different sections
of content. Tabs can be easily customized to match the style and design of the
website, and can be used to create a more user-friendly and interactive
experience for users.

### Using tabs in Bootstrap

To add tabs to a web page in Bootstrap, you can use the `nav` and `nav-tabs`
classes. The `nav` class specifies that the element is a navigation component,
while the `nav-tabs` class specifies that the navigation component is a set of
tabs. You can also add additional classes to customize the appearance and
behavior of the tabs, such as the size, position, alignment, and style of the
tabs. Tabs can be easily added to a web page using simple HTML and CSS classes,
and can be customized to match the style and design of the website.

Here is an example of how to create tabs in Bootstrap:

```html
<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
 <li class="nav-item">
  <a class="nav-link active" href="#tab1">Tab 1</a>
</li>
<li class="nav-item">
 <a class="nav-link" href="#tab2">Tab 2</a>
</li>
<li class="nav-item">
<a class="nav-link" href="#tab3">Tab 3</a>
</li>
</ul>
```


## Introduction to pills
