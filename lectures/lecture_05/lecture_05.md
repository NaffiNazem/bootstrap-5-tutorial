## Overview

In this lecture, we will cover containers in Bootstrap 5. Containers are a
fundamental building block in web design that help to organize and structure
the content of a web page. Bootstrap provides several container classes that
allow you to create responsive layouts and control the width of your content.
We will explore the different container classes available in Bootstrap and
learn how to use them effectively in your web projects.

## Topics Covered

- Container classes
- Fluid containers
- Nesting containers
- Container alignment

## Resources

- [Containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/)
- [Fluid containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/#fluid-containers)
- [Nesting containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/#nesting)
- [Container alignment](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/#alignment)

## Instructions

1. Open the "index.html" file in the lecture directory.
1. Explore the different container classes and their applications.
