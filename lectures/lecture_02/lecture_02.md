web pages. These utilities include headings, display headings, lead text,
inline text elements, and text colors.

## About Colors

Colors play a crucial role in web design, as they can evoke emotions, create
contrast, and guide the user's attention. Bootstrap provides a range of color
classes that allow you to style text and backgrounds in your web pages. These
classes include text colors, background colors, and contextual classes.

## Typography Utilities

Bootstrap provides a range of typography utilities that allow you to style

lead text, inline text elements, and text colors. By using these utilities,
you can create visually appealing and well-structured content.

## Color Classes

Bootstrap provides a range of color classes that allow you to style text and
backgrounds in your web pages. These classes include text colors, background
colors, and contextual classes. By using these classes, you can create
visually appealing and engaging designs that enhance the user experience.

## Examples

Let's take a look at some examples of typography and color classes in
Bootstrap
5. We will explore how to use these classes to style text and backgrounds in
your web pages.

### Headings

Bootstrap provides a range of heading classes that allow you to style
headings in your web pages. These classes include `h1` to `h6` for different
levels of headings. You can use these classes to create visually appealing
and well-structured content.

```html
<h1 class="display-1">Display 1</h1>
<h2 class="display-2">Display 2</h2>
<h3 class="display-3">Display 3</h3>
<h4 class="display-4">Display 4</h4>
<h5 class="display-5">Display 5</h5>
<h6 class="display-6">Display 6</h6>
```

### Lead Text

Bootstrap provides a lead class that allows you to style lead text in your
web pages. Lead text is used to emphasize important information and draw the
user's attention to specific content.

```html
<p class="lead">This is a lead paragraph.</p>
```

### Inline Text Elements

Bootstrap provides a range of inline text elements that allow you to style
text within a paragraph. These elements include `mark`, `del`, `s`, `ins`,
`u`, `small`, `strong`, `em`, `abbr`, `blockquote`, `sub`, and `sup`. You can
use these elements to add emphasis, highlight, or annotate text in your web
pages.

```html
<p><mark>Marked text</mark></p>
<p><del>Deleted text</del></p>
<p><s>Strikethrough text</s></p>
<p><ins>Inserted text</ins></p>
<p><u>Underlined text</u></p>
<p><small>Small text</small></p>
<p><strong>Strong text</strong></p>
<p><em>Emphasized text</em></p>
<p><abbr title="Abbreviation">Abbr</abbr></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
 <p class="mb-0">Blockquote text</p>
<footer class="blockquote-footer">Blockquote footer</footer>
</blockquote>
<p><sub>Subscript text</sub></p>
<p><sup>Superscript text</sup></p>
```

with different colors. These classes include `text-primary`,
`text-secondary`, `text-success`, `text-danger`, `text-warning`, `text-info`,
`text-light`, and `text-dark`. You can use these classes to create visually
appealing and engaging designs.

```html
<p class="text-primary">Primary text</p>
<p class="text-secondary">Secondary text</p>
<p class="text-success">Success text</p>
<p class="text-danger">Danger text</p>
<p class="text-warning">Warning text</p>
